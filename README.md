# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16

## Overview
We are looking over Amazon Reviews for Toys.  We are using tools such as AWS, Google Colab and pgAdmin to review the data.  Then we are narrowing down the data to reflect the Amazon Vine program.  Vine members publish reviews for products and we are determining what impact this has on overall reviews.

## Results
- Number of Vine Reviews:

## Summary
- Question:  Is there any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine Program?

Within the vine program, 34% of reviews were 5-star rated.  Within the non-vine program, 48% or reviews were 5-star rated.  You could say that the vine program does not have biased positive reviews because it's percentage is actually lower then the non-vine program.

- Additional analysis shows that overall there were 63,294 total reviews and 30,414 5-star Reviews.  The percentage shows that 48% of total reviews were 5-star.  This is the same as the percent of non-vine reviews (also 48%)

We can see that Vine reviews have very little impact on the total reviews, at only 2% of the total reviews in general.
